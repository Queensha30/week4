Operator precedence in Python simply refers to the order of operations. Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

# using the assigm operator 
x = 6
y = 2 
# to generate the Add AND operator i.e  x + y = 8
x += y
print(x) 
# to generate the subtract AND operator i.e x - y = 8 - 2 = 6  
x -= y 
print(x)
# to generate the multiply AND ooperator i.e x * y = 6 * 2 = 12
x *= y 
print(x)
# to generate the divide AND operator i.e x / 2 = 12 / 2 = 6  
x /= y 
print(x)
# to generate the modulo AND operator 1.e x %= 2 = 6 % 2 = 0
x %= y
print(x)
